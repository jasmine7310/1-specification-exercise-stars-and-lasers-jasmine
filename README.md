# Specification Phase Exercise

A little exercise to get started with the specification phase of the software development lifecycle. See the [instructions](instructions.md) for more detail.

## Stakeholders

See instructions. Delete this line and replace with the name(s) of the stakeholder(s) you interviewed and lists showing their goals/needs, and problems/frustrations.

Interview at least one person who is a good representative of the type of person for whom you are designing an app. Ask them questions about their goals, needs and desires. Find out problems and frustrations they have that a mobile app might be able to help with. You should be able to identify at least four goals/needs and four problems/frustrations.

Write details about your stakeholder(s) and their goals and furstrations into the [README.md](./README.md) file in the appropriate place.

## Product Vision Statement

See instructions. Delete this line and place your Product Vision Statement here.

Once your stakeholder has been interviewed, your team and they must settle on a foundational **Product Vision Statement** - a single sentence explaining the main concept of the app. The rest of your work will be based on this statement.

Write this Product Vision Statement into the `README.md` file in the appropriate place.

## User Requirements

See instructions. Delete this line and place a list of your User Stories here.

Develop user requirements for your proposed application idea. These will take the form of "user stories" - short, simple descriptions of a product feature told from the perspective of the person who wants it.

User stories follow the template,"`As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason].`", where `[type of user]`, `[some goal]` and `[some reason]` are replaced with appropriate values. Keep them small and written in non-technical language that the type of user would use.

Write at least 10 user stories into the `README.md` file in the appropriate place.

## Activity Diagrams

See instructions. Delete this line and place images of your UML Activity diagrams here.

Draw UML Activity Diagrams showing how a user uses the app to fulfill two of the user stories, from start to finish.

For each diagram, place the text of the corresponding user story and an image of the Activity Diagram into the `README.md` file in the appropriate place.

## Wireframe Diagrams

Create a set of wireframe diagrams representing every screen of the application. Wireframes are black-and-white diagrams that show the general layout of the screen, and the content that appears on each screen, but not the actual colors, images, fonts, or other visual design elements that will be used in the final product.

## Clickable Prototype

See instructions. Delete this line and place a publicly-accessible link to your clickable prototype here.

Convert the wireframe diagrams into a clickable prototype. These should be complete: every link or button in the prototype should take the user to the next screen in the flow; every place where actual content will go on each screen (i.e. every bit of text, image, or video) should be represented in the wireframe diagrams used in the clickable prototype. Use as little real-looking text as possible to make it obvious what will be written in the text blocks of the final product, while not showing so much that it distracts from the abstract purpose of the wireframe diagrams.

By using the clickable prototype, a non-technical person who is not closely involved with the project should be able to understand what the application is and how it works. Nothing should be left to the imagination.

Place a link to the published clickable prototype in the `README.md` file in the appropriate place. The link must not require a user to log in to view the prototype.
